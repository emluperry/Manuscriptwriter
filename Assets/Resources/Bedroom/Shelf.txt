Thinking: Still pretty bare, but he's put a couple of his comics out.
The camera focuses on Daniel.
Daniel: Oh yeah, I got the new edition of my favourite series!

The camera stops shaking.
Daniel: You can borrow it at some point if you want.
The camera focuses on the Player.
Player: Yeah, sure. Maybe another day?
