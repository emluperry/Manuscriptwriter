# Manu-Scriptwriter

Hi! If you've been sent this link, you've agreed to take part in the testing for Manu-Scriptwriter, my plugin for Unity 6, version 6000.0.19f1.

To get started, if you are unfamiliar with Github, click on the green Code button, then Download ZIP.

While you wait for that to download, take a look at the "Manu-Scriptwriter Testing Manual" pdf for more information on how to set everything up, including Unity. You can preview this file through Github or download it separately.

This guide also contains some basic information for navigating the folders, and includes all of the available commands/valid sentences.

Do not stress about making something that looks pretty, especially if you aren't familiar with Unity! Use some imagination, pretend the capsules are people and animals, or the cubes are objects and things to look at.

Thank you for taking part!
